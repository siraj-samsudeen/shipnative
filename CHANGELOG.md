## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Google Sign-In (Native)**: Switched native Google auth to ID token exchange using `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin`.
- **iOS URL Scheme Automation**: Auto-registers the Google iOS URL scheme from `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` in `app.config.ts`.
- **Node Tooling**: Added Volta pinning for Node 20 + Yarn 4 to stabilize installs.
- **GDPR Account Deletion**: Complete account deletion system with secure edge function, optional RevenueCat/PostHog data deletion, and cryptographic JWT verification.

### Changed
- **Env Vars**: Added `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` and removed the need for storing Google client secrets in the app.
- **Docs**: Updated Supabase + social login docs to align with the native Google ID token flow and Supabase guidance.
- **Auth Storage (iOS/Android)**: Switched Supabase session storage to `expo-secure-store` for more reliable persistence.
- **Auth Resilience**: Handle invalid refresh tokens, improve OAuth email-confirmation detection, and harden sign-out flows.
- **Paywall Routing**: Onboarding now passes context so Paywall can correctly reset to Main.
- **Supabase Schema**: Policies are now idempotent.
- **RevenueCat**: Suppress known paywall font registration errors.
- **Docs + Setup**: Setup wizard and README clarified Node version requirements.

### Migration Notes
- Pull the latest boilerplate changes and run `yarn install`.
- Install `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` (if upgrading from older versions).
- Add `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` to `apps/app/.env` (keep `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`).
- Rebuild the dev client so the Info.plist URL scheme is updated.
- Deploy the account deletion edge function: `npx supabase functions deploy delete-user --no-verify-jwt`

### Planned
- Stripe/PayPal add-ons alongside RevenueCat
- Expanded component library drops (charts, file uploads)
- Offline-first data patterns and caching presets
- More CI/CD recipes (GitHub Actions) and automated QA

## [1.0.0-rc2] - 2025-12-27

This update introduces the **AGENTS.md Standard**, a significant step forward in AI-assisted development of Shipnative. It improves context locality and reduces redundancy for AI agents.

### Added
- **AI Context**: Full adoption of the **AGENTS.md Standard**.
- **Nested Discovery**: Explicit instructions for agents to discover localized `AGENTS.md` files in `apps/app`, `landing_page`, and `mintlify_docs`.
- **Claude Integration**: Updated `CLAUDE.md` with `@AGENTS.md` import syntax for Claude Code compatibility.

### Changed
- **Marketing**: Rebranded all "vibe folder" mentions to "AGENTS.md Standard" on the landing page and throughout the documentation.

## [1.0.0-rc1] - 2025-12-26

New update with many improvements and reliability fixes. It's recommended to use this new version of the boilerplate for future developments or pull these changes in if you've recently started!

### Added
- **Authentication**: Refactored `useAuth` to support the **PKCE flow** for OAuth logins.
- **In-App Social Login**: Integrated `expo-web-browser` for a seamless social login experience.
- **Diagnostics**: Smarter network error messages that suggest checking project status in the Supabase dashboard.
- **Styling**: Introduced a comprehensive Neutral/Slate palette across the entire design system.

### Changed
- **Navigation**: Finalized deep linking configuration in `App.tsx` for all core screens and tab routes.
- **Mock Mode**: Updated mock authentication to support code-to-session exchange simulation.

### Fixed
- **Subscriptions**: Implemented auto-reset and sync for `subscriptionStore` on auth state changes.
- **Hardened RLS**: Updated Supabase policies for `profiles` and `waitlist` tables for better security/privacy.
- **Linting**: Cleaned up code regressions and Prettier formatting across all repositories.
